<p align="center">
An RFC 851 compliant implementation of SMTP written in golang
</p>

### Getting started

The package is not available in any repositories at the moment, so you will have to build from source.
After running `go install`, you can run it to see the available options.

```
smtpd --help
```

### What is this?

This is not production ready. It is a compliant implementation of RFC 851 that is meant to be used for debugging purposes.
I am also using this project as a learning tool and reference for others wanting to learn how to implement common protocols.
As of now, I plan on making a tool similar to [mailcatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/).
